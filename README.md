# BlackJack
#### This is a very popular game here implemented by queue. There are three stages where you can track how the logic behind is built.

## Start the game
1. If you want to play the primitive version of Blackjack, in command line, do things similar to ```java Blackjack 200 4 10```, which means 200 rounds played with 4 shoes, tracing the first 10 rounds. You can change the numbers as you want. This will give you the result with out any interaction.  <img width="955" alt="Screen Shot 2021-11-01 at 11 01 21 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55789923/139780139-557a2bc2-56ce-4367-b6b3-e36b26bdc40f.png">
2. if you want to play the interactive version of Blackjack where you can bet, do things similar to ```java NewBlackjackGame 1```, which means play with 1 deck of cards.   <img width="955" alt="Screen Shot 2021-11-01 at 11 08 33 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55789923/139780723-da536b75-a0dc-42b6-ad7c-12bd5973782f.png">

2. Shuffle the discard pile when needed.
3. Type in however many decks you want to play with.
4. NewBlackjackGame is fun :)
